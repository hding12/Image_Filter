You will need the Python Imaging Library (PIL) (or the Pillow fork). Under Debian/Ubuntu, this is the package python-imaging or python3-imaging.

Install Google Tesseract OCR (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseractadditional info how to install the engine on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows). You must be able to invoke the tesseract command as tesseract.
